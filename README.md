The repository resources for the two experiments, each of which contains:
1. Jupyter notebooks with code for the proposed methodology with both GradCAM and Saliency maps.
2. Weights of the best-performing model for each method
3. Train test split of the [PAD-UFES-20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235234092031115X) dataset used for experiments.
